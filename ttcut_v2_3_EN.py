ttcut V2 — table tennis match video: tag rallies, cut the ball-chasing, burn in a
persistent scoreboard. One tool, start to finish.

Versioning
    small changes +0.1 (V1 -> V1.1 -> V1.2 ...)
    architectural or output-format changes bump the whole number (V2)

Changelog
    V2.3-EN 2026-09-13
        - English interface build of V2.3. Identical scoring, cutting, stats and
          rendering behaviour; only user-facing text and comments differ.
    V2.3 2026-09-13
        - New "stats board": tick it and the last frame is frozen at the end of
          the film with a centred summary board drawn over it
        - Top half is the per-game score table (name -> games won -> each game),
          with the winning number in the accent colour
        - Bottom half splits left/right and lists points won, service win rate
          and longest streak for each player
        - The longest streak carries across games: two 11:0 games in a row is 22
        - Hold duration is adjustable (1s by default); the audio is padded with
          silence over the freeze so picture and sound stay the same length
        - Stored in the tags JSON under stats; the CLI adds --stats / --no-stats
          / --stats-hold
        - With the box unticked, the generated .ass and filter graph are
          byte-identical to V2.2
        - Also fixed: Homebrew has no ffmpeg formula, so the instructions
          now say brew install ffmpeg
    V2.2-EN 2026-08-30
        - English interface build of V2.2. Same scoring, cutting and rendering
          behaviour; only user-facing text and comments changed.
        - Default player names are now "Player A" / "Player B"
    V2.2 2026-08-30
        - Wider number fields: pad seconds (0.5, 1.0) and frame rate (29.97)
          used to get clipped
    V2.1 2026-08-30
        - Scoreboard accent colour is configurable: the point digits and the
          bar to the left of the names change together
        - The colour is stored in the tags JSON as scoreboard.accent, so it
          travels with the file across machines
        - New --accent flag on the command line, which wins over the JSON value
        - With no colour given, the generated .ass is byte-identical to V2;
          every other colour is untouched
    V2  2026-08-24
        - Merged into a single tool: run it and it starts a server, opens the
          browser, and one button turns your tags into a finished video
        - Scoring lives in Python only (/fold); the tagger's JS copy is gone
          -- rule changes now happen in one place, no JS/Python cross-checking
        - Serve-rotation logic moved out of JS into the same fold()
        - Fixed the mismatch between tagger and ttcut on the minimum cut length
          (0.15s shown, 2.0s actually cut). Both now use one value, adjustable
          in the interface
        - Video is served by Python with HTTP Range support, so scrubbing and
          Safari playback work
        - The video path comes from a native file dialog opened by Python
          (browsers never hand over the real path)
        - ffmpeg -progress drives a real progress bar; rendering runs in the
          background and does not block the UI
        - Unchanged: JSON export/import and the command-line render path both
          behave exactly as in V1.22
    V1.22 2026-08-20
        - Starting game count (for one video per game, continuing a match)
        - Starting score / handicap, applied every game or first game only
        - Capped mode: after 10:10 the first to 12 wins, no need to win by two
        - JSON gains format / start blocks; older files fall back to defaults
    V1.2 2026-08-20
        - Fixed a fatal bug: the V1.1 refactor dropped -c:v, so ffmpeg had been
          silently falling back to the default libx264
        - Added --hwaccel; videotoolbox hardware decoding is on by default on Mac
        - --hdr keep falls back automatically on non-HDR sources
        - libx264/libx265 switch to bitrate mode when --bitrate is given
    V1.1 2026-08-20
        - Scoreboard: game count became "filled chip + dark digits"
        - Quality: frame rate follows the source, bitrate derived from
          resolution x frame rate, three --quality tiers, HDR detection
    V1  2026-08-20  first working version

Usage:
    python3 ttcut_v2_3_EN.py                                    <- open the UI (the usual way)
    python3 ttcut_v2_3_EN.py IMG_1496.tags.json IMG_1496.MOV    <- render from the command line
    python3 ttcut_v2_3_EN.py tags.json video.MOV --quality max --dry-run

Requirements:
    Python 3.8+ and ffmpeg (not bundled, install it yourself)
    Mac    : brew install ffmpeg     (the subtitles filter needs libass)
    Windows: drop ffmpeg.exe next to this script, or point --ffmpeg at its folder
